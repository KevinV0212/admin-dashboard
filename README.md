# admin-dashboard
A mock admin dashboard page (The Odin Project)

This is project involves using my knowledge of grid-layouts to create
and organized admin dashboard webpage.

The general layout of the page will follow the example shown in: 'example.png'.  
A replication of the provided design is provided in 'replication.html'. In 
Addition to the layout and design, I have added a decent level of desktop level
responsiveness. There is currently no mobile layout


The main page will be 'index.html'. The main page has the same layout as 
'replication.html' but has more personalized styling and content.
